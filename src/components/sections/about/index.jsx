        From a young age, I've been fascinated by the world of computers and
        software. Features like copy, paste, and undo seemed magical and touch
        screens were a joy to use. Along the way, I've developed a keen interest
        in visual design, and found my calling to digital Product Design. I am a
        UI/UX designer with a passion for creating user-friendly and visually
        appealing digital experiences. My goal is to design interfaces that are
        not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitive and easy to navigate.{" "}
